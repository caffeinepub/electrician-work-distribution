# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace "Television Services" with "Request a Service" throughout the app, update service categories, and add new education options to the worker job application form.

**Planned changes:**
- Rename all references to "Television Services" (sidebar nav, landing page card, page heading) to "Request a Service"
- Update the service type/work detail options on the Request a Service page to: Television Repair, AC Repair, Fridge Repair, Ceiling Fan Repair, and Table Fan Repair
- Update backend data model/types to support the new service categories
- Add the following options to the Preferred Education field in the worker job apply form: Electronic Commerce Engineering, AC Mechanic, Electrical Engineering, ITI (Electrician Trade), Diploma in Refrigeration & Air Conditioning, Diploma in Electronics & Communication

**User-visible outcome:** Customers can request a service by selecting from five appliance repair types, and job applicants can choose from additional relevant education qualifications when applying to work.
