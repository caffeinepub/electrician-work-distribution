  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements. REQ-1 is addressed by a simplified single-click apply dialog in JobBoard.tsx replacing the multi-step stepper. REQ-2 is addressed by a 'Join Us' empty-state panel shown when no jobs are available. REQ-3 is addressed by new backend functions in main.mo (subscribeForJobAlerts / getJobAlertSubscribers) with stable storage via migration.mo. REQ-4 is addressed by wiring the 'Join Us' button to the backend via useSubscribeToJobAlerts mutation with success/disabled states and login prompt. All requirements appear to be implemented based on available evidence.",

      "description": "A migration module (backend/migration.mo) was added as a separate file to handle state migration for the new jobAlertSubscriptions map.",
      "reason": "The build request specifies that all Motoko logic must remain in the single backend/main.mo actor file. The migration module is an additional separate file not permitted by the constraints.",
