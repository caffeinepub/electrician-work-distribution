  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements. REQ-1 is addressed by updating the sidebar nav item and landing page card to 'Request a Service', and the Services.tsx page heading reflects 'Request a Service'. REQ-2 is implemented in both the frontend (Services.tsx, JobBoard.tsx SERVICE_TYPES) and backend (main.mo RepairServiceType, migration.mo). REQ-3 is implemented in JobBoard.tsx EDUCATION_OPTIONS with all six required options plus preserved existing ones. All acceptance criteria appear to be met.",

      "reason": "REQ-3 specifies adding education options to the worker Job Apply multi-step form. The diff also adds an EDUCATION_OPTIONS array and preferredEducation field to Services.tsx (the customer-facing service request page), which was not part of any requirement.",
