  "summary": "The diff shows that WorkOrders.tsx was modified and the file summary explicitly states the 'Verify' tab label was renamed to 'Verify Application'. REQ-1 requires moving the 'Work Order' navigation/tab option to appear under the 'Verify Application' section, not simply renaming the tab. The acceptance criteria specify that 'Work Order' is no longer under 'Verify' and is now accessible under 'Verify Application' as a sub-option or nested item. The file summary describes only a label rename, which may not satisfy the requirement of moving the 'Work Order' option to appear as a structurally distinct sub-item under 'Verify Application'.",
